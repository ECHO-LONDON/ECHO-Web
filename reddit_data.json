There is not legitimate political discourse because the subreddit is significantly biased, as are the moderators, and they moderate based on said bias.

After 2.5 years of this crap, I'm finally on the verge of being fired/laid off or whatever the next step is before that. I can tell it from how my manager has been treating me the past few months or so (I have not had any 1-on-1's with him for several months now AND hes been excluding me from trainings that all other team members who've been with the company under 2 years are being explicitly mentioned to be invited to). The team leader directly leading me on my immediate team hardly assigns me work anymore and minimizes his interactions with me specifically just to receive updates. Outside of my team, other coworkers don't really interact with me. I'm not really invited to meetings outside of team meetings. With the other engineers who are in the same YOE as I am, they're typically very passive aggressive towards me, saying stuff like \"wow, see &lt;other coworker's name&gt;, I told you that &lt;my name&gt; was doing important work. Wow, very cool!\" and the other coworker would interject with another snide comment and they're using a sarcastic tone of voice. I can recall MANY instances in our internal team meetings where my manager or another manager or even my team lead is saying \"hey, lets not be open about certain details/issues when we have our meetings with other people from departments\". And I'm someone who sort of let it slide.\n\nWhen I recall the internship I did before this job, it was even more toxic. Coworkers who weren't afraid to show me that they hated me, would immediately act nice and helpful when management was around and observing. I could recall that I was used for other people's benefit, whether that was my former manager trying to manipulate one of my coworkers or a coworker trying to look like he was being helpful to me when he offered his contact information during my exit out of my internship. Theres so many toxic people in the professional world.\n\nI hate not being honest especially around the issues at work. Its really tiring. When I reflect on how my dad, who is a retired mechanic, transitioned from working under other people in their auto shops to renting out his own autoshop and working as an independent mechanic, it kind of makes sense. My dad is a really honest guy who genuinely likes helping other people. But, the fucking work industry is full of snakes who bully/sabotage other people to get ahead. Really, theres no place for people like me here.

Fine, whatever, I've dealt with that before.\n\nBut what gets me is that going over my resume, he gets to the point where I say that I am fully vaccinated against covid-19.

I do sincerely think that he wasn't a political guy before and he was genuinely curious but as the cast got bigger, I think politics found him and he has since become quite bullish on his ideas. Since the Bernie episode + Covid + moving to Texas + money I think the gravity around him got too dense and I don't blame him. \n\nI do remember his point on politics before was 'It's a weird system anyway no one can be trusted, and no one person should be running the country it should be a team of people'. I always liked this take because I felt it was a genuine idea and he never tied himself to a side (being true to the comedian who just likes to talk about cool shit). and the point would last 2-5 minutes and then conversation would flow again.  After covid he started complaining of sides and then clearly picked one, I think he has unknowingly become what he is complaining about before. He preaches on episodes, Biden is worked into every episode, and he clearly gets off talking about cancel culture, I think he would be more upset if cancel culture went away because he wouldn't have anything to talk about (he literally just does the same thing but on the other side and repeats his points non-stop). \n\nIdk, I just wanted to see if I'm the only one because he is clearly still the number 1 podcast in the world and every episode is marked as 'most shared'.

Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL).\n\n**Secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.\n\n**Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name \"neural\" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the \"godfathers\" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.\n\n**Fourthly**, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people won't solve any issue.\n\n**Fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. At our CS faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.\n\n**Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a \"broader impact\" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion (besides a few Indaba workshops).\n\n**Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective.\n\n**Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved.\n\nAlbert Einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular. \n\nThe moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies. \n\nBest intentions, Yusuf", "relevance": 0}, {"search": 2, "content": "Machine learning is getting smarter than ever before ", "relevance": 0}, {"search": 2, "content": "sometimes machine learning algorithms are very funny ", "relevance": 0}, {"search": 2, "content": "A machine learning joke (credits to u/z0ltan_x) ", "relevance": 0}, {"search": 2, "content": "Machine learning much?

If you don't want to click on each one individually, they're all in an imgur album [here](https://imgur.com/a/5nkFTu4).\n\nThere is a tl;dr at the end of the post.\n\n***\n\n#Introduction\n\nWhen picking in the top-10 of a draft, teams have one goal: select a franchise-altering player with star potential. Though some teams draft for need and prefer to select more NBA-ready players, in general, GMs do their best to select a player who may become a star.\n\nThis is very challenging. Many factors affect a player\u2019s ability to become a star. Along with college performance, factors like athleticism, intangibles, injuries, coaching, and more change a player\u2019s star potential.\n\nAs fans on the outside looking in, we have limited information on most of these factors except one: college performance. Though even the college performance of many players needs context (such as Cam Reddish\u2019s low volume stats due to playing with Zion Williamson and R.J. Barrett), it\u2019s one of the only quantifiable factors we can use. So, let\u2019s try to use college stats to predict All-Stars in the top-10 of the 2019 draft.\n\n***\n\n#Methods\n\nFirst, I created a database of every top-10 pick from the 1990-2015 NBA drafts. We use 1990 as the limit because it ensures every player played their entire college career with a 3-point line. The 2015 draft was set as an upper limit so that all players played the entirety of their rookie contract, giving them some chance to make an All-Star team.\n\nIn addition to collecting their college stats, I marked whether the prospect made an All-Star team. There is no consideration for whether the player became an All-Star while on the team that drafted him, how long it took him to get there, etc. All data was collected from Sports-Reference.\n\nPlayers who made an All-Star team at some point in their career earned a \u201c1\u201d in the All-Star column. Meanwhile, players who failed to make an All-Star team earned a \u201c0.\u201d\n\nThis represents a binary classification problem. There are two classes we\u2019re looking at: All-Star and not All-Star. The models try to match each player to one of the two classes. We\u2019ll also look at the prediction probability (probability for the player to be in the class) the models give each player.\n\nTo create the models, we used the following stats as inputs:\n\n|Counting stats|Efficiency|Other|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|PPG|TS%|Pick|\n|TRB|3PAr|SOS|\n|AST|FTr||\n|STL|||\n|BLK|||\n\nNote that win shares, box plus/minus, and other holistic advanced stats that are excluded. College BPM data is available only from the 2011 draft, and college WS data is available only from the 1996 draft. Therefore, using BPM restricts the data set massively. Though adding WS only excludes 6 years of drafts, the models were significantly less accurate when including WS.\n\nThe models predicted whether the player made an All-Star team (the 1s or 0s described above).\n\nWe collected the same set of stats for the top-10 picks in the 2019 draft. When using the models to All-Stars out of the 2019 draft, we\u2019ll look primarily at the prediction probabilities of the positive class. A prediction probability of 0.75 indicates that the model is 75% certain the player will fall into class 1 (All-Star). Therefore, every player with a prediction probability above 0.5 would be predicted as a 1 if we just used the models to predict classes instead of probability.\n\nGiven that about 31% of top-10 picks since 1990, the prediction probabilities give us more information about the predictions. If we\u2019d just predict the classes, we\u2019d likely get 2-4 1s, and the rest be 0s. However, with the prediction probabilities, we can see whether a player has a higher All-Star probability than others drafted at his pick historically, making him a seemingly good value.\n\nNote that unlike other problems like predicting All-NBA teams \u2013 where voters have general tendencies making the problem easy to predict accurately \u2013 predicting All-Stars is incredibly difficult. Players develop differently, and college stats alone are not nearly enough to accurately project a player\u2019s All-Star potential. We don\u2019t expect the models to incredibly accurate. After all, if they were, teams would use better models higher quality data to make predictions that would help them always pick All-Stars.\n\nIn total, we made four models:\n\n1. Logistic classifier (LOG)\n2. Support vector classifier (SVC)\n3. Random forest classifier (RF)\n4. Gradient boosting classifier (GBC)\n\n***\n\n#Comparing All-Star and not All-Star stats\n\nLet\u2019s compare some college stats between All-Stars and not All-Stars. This will illustrate just how difficult it is to differentiate the two groups based off just their college stats.\n\nBefore diving into the differences (or lack thereof), let\u2019s first establish how to read these plots. This type of graph is called a boxplot. The yellow line represents the median or middle value in each group. The top of the box signifies the 75th percentile, while the bottom of the box signifies the 25th percentile. So, the 25th-50th percentile can be seen between the bottom of the box and the yellow line. From the yellow line to the top of the box represents the 50th-75th percentile. The full box represents the 25th-75th percentile of the data.\n\nThe lines flowing out of the box are called \u201cwhiskers.\u201d The top of the whisker, or the \u201cT\u201d shape, represents the greatest value, excluding outliers. The bottom whisker represents the opposite (the lowest value excluding outliers). From the top of the box to the top of the whisker represents the 75th-100th percentile. The bottom of the box to the bottom of the whisker represents the 0th-25th percentile. Therefore, the top of the box also represents the median of the upper half of the data set.\n\nThe dots above or below the whiskers represent outliers. Outliers above the whiskers represent points that are greater than the upper quartile (top of the box) + 1.5 times then interquartile range (top of the box \u2013 bottom of the box). Outliers below the whiskers represent points that are less than the lower quartile (bottom of the box) \u2013 1.5 times then interquartile range (top of the box \u2013 bottom of the box).\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at their points per game.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/W344Rfe.png\n\nThough the All-Stars have a marginally higher median PPG, the not All-Stars have a higher upper quartile PPG (top of the whisker). Therefore, there\u2019s no clear difference here between the two groups, especially given that the bottom whiskers extend similarly for both groups.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at rebounds and assists. Because big men will get more rebounds, and guards will get more assists, All-Stars and not All-Stars seems to be an odd comparison. However, we\u2019re just looking for differences in basic counting stats.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/P9vayUu.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GoSlUqV.png\n\nFor rebounds, there\u2019s practically no difference yet again. Both groups show a nearly identical median and very similar ranges. For assists, the All-Stars have a higher median assist total, and the 25th-75th percentile range stretches higher. Therefore, there\u2019s a small difference between the two.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the difference in strength of schedule (SOS).\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ejj28M6.png\n\nYet again, there\u2019s a minimal difference. The medians are almost equal. Though the All-Stars range is higher than the not All-Stars range, there are multiple low outliers for the All-Stars.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s look at the difference in picks.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/D95LjtS.png\n\nThis is the first pronounced difference. The median pick of an All-Star is much lower than that of a not All-Star. Because no other stats showed any significant difference between the two groups, we can expect pick to be the most important feature in the models. Furthermore, this difference shows that NBA GMs are generally pretty good at drafting.\n\n\n***\n\n#Model analysis\n\n##Model creation: data transformation\n\nAfter creating the four models described above and testing their accuracy with basic metrics (discussed later), I did two things.\n\nFirst, I tried manipulating the data. To make the models, I initially used the raw data. Sometimes, normalizing the data may lead to better performance. Normalizing the data means scaling each individual stat so that the highest value is 1 and the lowest value is 0. This can be done across the entire data set (the player with the highest college PPG would have a PPG input to the models of 1) or to each draft year (the player with the highest college PPG in each draft year would have a PPG input to the models of 1). Neither of these methods increased performance.\n\nNext, I tried transforming the data into ranks. Instead of giving raw or normalized stats, we can simply rank all the players by their stats. Like normalization, this gives us some method to compare the players. However, ranking each stat for neither the entire data set nor each draft year improved performance.\n\nAfter all, we\u2019ll use the usual, raw data we got from Sports Reference.\n\n##Model creation: hyperparameter tuning\n\nEvery model has certain characteristics that determine how the model fits the data. These characteristics, or hyperparameters, make the model\u2019s architecture. For example, if we were using an exponential model, the degree (quadratic, cubic, quartic, etc.) would be a hyperparameter. Hyperparameters impact the model\u2019s performance.\n\nIn previous posts, I used nice round numbers for the model hyperparameters and played around with them randomly until I found a mix that yielded a strong model. However, this is not scientific.\n\nFor a scientific hyperparameter tuning, we can use a method called grid search. Grid search takes a grid of possible values for hyperparameters we want to test, creates a model for each possible combination, evaluates the model\u2019s accuracy, and returns the \u201cbest\u201d model. In this case, we want to find the model that has the best recall (a metric we\u2019ll discuss soon).\n\nThe SVC, RF, and GBC saw their performance improve with the hyperparameters from the grid search. So, for those models, we used the best parameters found by the grid search. For the LOG, we used the parameters we set before the grid search (in this case, the default).\n\n##Basic goodness-of-fit\n\nWe measure the performance of classification models in several ways. The simplest metric is accuracy, which measures the percentage of predictions the model made correctly. Essentially, it takes the list of predictions and finds how many values in the list were perfect matches to the list of results.\n\nBecause this is the simplest classification metric, it has its flaws. Accuracy only measures correct predictions, so it may be misleading in some cases. For example, if we\u2019re predicting something very rare, then almost all the results will be 0s. Therefore, a model that exclusively predicts 0s will have a high accuracy even if it has no predictive power.\n\nGiven that there are more not All-Stars than All-Stars, accuracy is not the best metric in this case. 30% of the testing set consists of All-Stars, meaning a model could achieve 70% accuracy by predicting all 0s (that no one will be an All-Star). However, because picking correct All-Stars at the expense of picking some incorrect All-Stars is better than picking no All-Stars at all, it\u2019s fine to have an accuracy less than 70%.\n\nTo understand the next few classification metrics, we must first establish some terms. A true positive occurs when the model predicts a 1, and the actual value is a 1 (meaning the model correctly predicted an All-Star). A true negative is the opposite; the model correctly predicts a 0. False positives occur when the model predicts a 1 where the actual value is 0, and false negatives occur when the model predicts a 0 where the actual value is 1.\n\nRecall measures a model\u2019s ability to predict the positive class. In this case, it\u2019s the model\u2019s ability to find all the All-Stars (true positives). Recall = TP / (TP + FN), meaning that a \u201cperfect\u201d model that predicts every positive class correctly will have a recall of 1. Recall is arguably the most important metric here.\n\nPrecision measures how many of the returned predicted All-Stars were true. It penalizes the model for incorrectly predicting a bunch of All-Stars. Precision = TP / (TP + FP), meaning that a \u201cperfect\u201d model will have a precision of 1. Notice that there is typically a trade-off between precision and recall given that recall measures ability to find true positives, while precision measures ability to limit false positives.\n\nTo combine the two metrics, we can use F1. F1 = 2(precision * recall) / (precision + recall). By combining precision and recall, F1 lets us compare two models with different precisions and recalls. Like recall and precision, F1 values are between 0 and 1, with 1 being the best.\n\nNow that we\u2019re familiar with some classification metrics, let\u2019s examine the models\u2019 performance. The table below shows the scores of all four models on the previously mentioned metrics.\n\n|Model|Accuracy|Recall|Precision|F1|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|LOG|0.746|0.316|0.667|0.429|\n|SVC|0.762|0.263|0.833|0.4|\n|RF|0.746|0.368|0.636|0.467|\n|GBC|0.73|0.368|0.583|0.452|\n\nThe RF and GBC had the highest recall, though the RF had higher precision and accuracy than the GBC. Although the SVC had the highest precision and accuracy, we\u2019re most concerned with recall, meaning the other models are stronger. The LOG appears slightly weaker than the RF and GBC, though it\u2019s still a strong model.\n\nAs mentioned before, we\u2019re not expecting dazzling performance from the models. After all, if models using publicly available data could predict All-Stars, NBA teams with full analytics staffs would have no problem finding them. Therefore, though these metrics are not encouraging by themselves, they show that the models have some predictive power.\n\n##Improvement over random\n\nTo show that the models are stronger than randomly predicting All-Stars, I made a dummy classifier. The dummy classifier randomly predicts players to be a 1 or 0 with respect to the training set\u2019s class distribution. Given that the training set had 32% All-Stars (the testing set had 30% as mentioned earlier), the dummy classifier will randomly predict 32% of the testing set to be All-Stars.\n\nThe table below shows the dummy classifier\u2019s performance.\n\n|Model|Accuracy|Recall|Precision|F1|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|Dummy|0.556|0.316|0.286|0.3|\n\nEach of our four models has higher accuracy, precision, and F1 scores than the dummy classifier. It is slightly concerning that the dummy classifier has equal recall to the LOG and higher recall than the SVC. Nevertheless, the LOG and SVC were much better at getting their All-Star predictions correct when they did predict them (higher precision).\n\n##Confusion matrices\n\nTo help visualize a model\u2019s accuracy, we can use a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix shows the predicted vs. actual classes in the test set for each model. It plots each model\u2019s true positives (bottom right), true negatives (top left), false positive (top right), and false negatives (bottom left) in a square.\n\nThe testing set was small; it had only 63 data points. Below are the confusion matrices for all four models.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/H1DeMjc.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kTgdOrV.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jgQmTDV.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NjcmZW9.png\n\n##Cross-validation\n\nAs we do in other machine learning posts, we want to cross-validate our models. This will ensure that they didn\u2019t \u201cmemorize\u201d the correct weights for this specific split of data, meaning they overfit.\n\nIn classification problems, it\u2019s important to see that the class balance is close to even between the training and testing set. This could influence cross-validation, given that a different split of the data might have a large imbalance. Our training set had 32% All-Stars while our testing set had 30% All-Stars, making this a non-factor.\n\nThe table below shows the cross-validated accuracy (k = 3) and the scores\u2019 95% confidence interval.\n\n|Model|CV accuracy|95% confidence interval|\n:--|--:|:--|\n|LOG|0.665|+/- 0.096|\n|SVC|0.683|+/- 0.027|\n|RF|0.746|+/- 0.136|\n|GBC|0.633|+/- 0.135|\n\nEvery model has a cross-validated accuracy score that\u2019s close to its real accuracy score.\n\n##Log loss and ROC curves\n\nThe final metrics we\u2019ll use are log loss and ROC curves.\n\nLog loss is essentially like accuracy with prediction probabilities instead of predicted classes. Lower log loss is better. Because we\u2019re interested in the prediction probabilities, log loss is an important metric here. Though log loss isn\u2019t exactly simple to interpret by itself, it\u2019s useful for comparing models.\n\nThe table below shows the four models\u2019 log loss values.\n\n|Model|Log loss|\n:--|--:|\n|LOG|0.546|\n|SVC|0.56|\n|RF|0.556|\n|GBC|1.028|\n\nThe biggest takeaway from the log loss is that the GBC may not be as strong as we initially thought, given that all the other models have significantly lower log loss scores.\n\nThe second to last metric we\u2019ll look at is the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under it. The curve shows the \u201cseparation\u201d between true positives and true negatives by plotting them against each other. The area gives us a numerical value for this separation.\n\nA model with no overlap in probability between TP and TN (perfect) would have a right-angled ROC curve and an area under the curve of 1. As the overlap increases (meaning the model is worse) the curve gets closer to the line y = x.\n\nThe ROC curves and the area under the curve for each model is below.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kmGla77.png\n\nEach model has a similar ROC curve and area under the curve.\n\n***\n\n#Why do the models predict what they do?\n\nBefore going into the results, the last thing we\u2019ll want to look at is what the models find important in predicting All-Stars. There are a couple ways to do this.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll look at the model coefficients and feature importances. The LOG and SVC have coefficients, while the RF and GBC have feature importances. Coefficients are different from feature importances in that the coefficients are used to express the model in an equation. Higher coefficients do not mean the feature is more important, they just mean the model scaled that feature differently. On their own, they don\u2019t have much meaning for us, but for comparison purposes, we can see which model scales a certain factor more.\n\nThe graph below shows the coefficients of the LOG and SVC.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MjISg1X.png\n\nThe two models have very similar coefficients for the most part. The two main differences are in the steals and blocks coefficients. While the LOG gives blocks a negative coefficient, the SVC gives it a positive coefficient. Furthermore, the LOG gives steals a much higher coefficient than the SVC.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at feature importances. Feature importance shows how much the model relies on a feature by measuring how much the model\u2019s error increases without it. Higher feature importance indicates more reliance on the feature.\n\nThe graph below shows the feature importances of the RF and GBC.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mNUa0SW.png\n\nAs we would expect, pick was the most important feature for both models (the GBC point covers the RF point). Interestingly, SOS was almost as important to the GBC as pick.\n\n##Shapley values\n\nTo get a more detailed view of how each feature impacted each model, we can use a more advanced model explanation metric called Shapley values.\n\nShapley value is defined as the \u201caverage marginal contribution of a feature value over all possible coalitions.\u201d It tests every prediction for an instance using every combo of our inputs. This along with other similar methods gives us more information about how much each individual feature affects each model in each case.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll look at the mean SHAP value, or average impact of each feature on each of the four models. A higher value indicates a more important feature.\n\nThe four graphs below show the mean SHAP values for each of the four models (in order of LOG, SVC, RF, GBC).\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2zv7BGd.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ysMmlhg.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GqRoVj7.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/51GcrlK.png\n\nThe LOG, RF, and GBC all have pick as the most important feature, as expected. Steals being the second most important feature is surprising. The three models all have pick, steals, rebounds, and assists in their top-5 most important features.\n\nThe SVC has odd results, as pick was only the third most important feature behind rebounds and assists.\n\nTo get a more detailed and individualized view of the feature impacts, we can look at the SHAP value for each point.\n\nIn the graphs below, the x-axis represents the SHAP value. The higher the magnitude on the x-axis (very positive or very negative), the more the feature impacts the model. The color indicates the feature value, with red being high values and blue being low values. So, a blue point for pick indicates the player was picked early.\n\nWith these plots, we can make conclusions like \u201cpick is very important to the models when its value is low but becomes less important as players are picked later.\u201d\n\nThe four graphs below show the individual point SHAP and feature values.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/FbarVSw.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HKheCGM.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CUSmVbd.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/puJObd8.png\n\nFor the LOG, pick mattered a lot when its value was low. As players were picked later, it had less of an impact on model output. The SVC was more affected by high assists, rebounds, and steal values than low pick values, unlike other models.\n\nRebounds had minimal impact on the RF except for cases where the player\u2019s rebound total was very low. The opposite is true for TS% in both the RF and GBC; generally, TS% had minimal impact on the model except for the highest TS% values. For the GBC, the highest SOS values had a very high impact on model output.\n\n***\n\n#Results\n\nTo make predictions for the 2019 draft, we looked at prediction probabilities instead of predicted classes. This gives us each model\u2019s probability that the player makes an All-Star team.\n\nThe four graphs below show each model\u2019s predictions.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RohPa4F.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mIlxG9X.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HqmnVoc.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9wKvXAY.png\n\nEvery model gives Zion the highest All-Star probability. The LOG and SVC\u2019s top-3 in All-Star probability mimic the draft\u2019s top-3. However, the RF and GBC love Jaxson Hayes; both models gave him the second-highest All-Star probability, just above Ja Morant. Both the RF and GBC also dislike DeAndre Hunter, giving him the lowest All-Star probability.\n\nThe graph below shows the average prediction of the four models.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/c9JSRWj.png\n\nThe RF and GBC propel Jaxson Hayes to the fourth-highest average predicted All-Star probability.\n\nThe table below shows each model's predictions and the average of the predictions.\n\n|Pick|Player|LOG|SVC|RF|GBC|Average|\n--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|1|Zion Williamson|0.71|0.63|0.80|1.00|0.78|\n|2|Ja Morant|0.65|0.49|0.58|0.91|0.66|\n|3|RJ Barrett|0.37|0.49|0.53|0.62|0.50|\n|4|DeAndre Hunter|0.22|0.23|0.16|0.00|0.15|\n|5|Darius Garland|0.19|0.24|0.42|0.10|0.23|\n|6|Jarrett Culver|0.25|0.30|0.48|0.47|0.37|\n|7|Coby White|0.15|0.27|0.31|0.16|0.22|\n|8|Jaxson Hayes|0.08|0.17|0.61|0.94|0.45|\n|9|Rui Hachimura|0.07|0.11|0.17|0.00|0.09|\n|10|Cam Reddish|0.10|0.20|0.35|0.28|0.23|\n\nTo determine the best value picks according to the models, we can compare each player\u2019s predicted All-Star probability to the percent of players drafted in his slot that made an All-Star team in our data set (1990-2015 drafts). So, if a first pick and a tenth pick both have 80% All-Star probability, the tenth pick will be a better relative value because many more first picks make All-Star teams.\n\nThe graph below shows the All-Star probability minus the percent of players drafted in the slot that make an All-Star team for each player.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Akivph3.png\n\nThe graph below sorts the difference from greatest to least.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IySAp4R.png\n\nThe models love Ja Morant and Jaxson Hayes as great values. Meanwhile, the models dislike the #4 and #5 picks \u2013 DeAndre Hunter and Darius Garland.\n\nPart of the reason Morant has such a large difference is that #2 picks have an unusually low All-Star total. The table below shows the difference in All-Star probability. Notice that only 40% of #2 picks in our data set made an All-Star team, while 56% of #3 picks made one.\n\n|Pick|Player|All-Star % at pick # since 1990|Average prediction|Difference|\n--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|\n|1|Zion Williamson|0.64|0.78|0.14|\n|2|Ja Morant|0.4|0.66|0.26|\n|3|RJ Barrett|0.56|0.50|-0.06|\n|4|DeAndre Hunter|0.32|0.15|-0.17|\n|5|Darius Garland|0.4|0.23|-0.17|\n|6|Jarrett Culver|0.24|0.37|0.13|\n|7|Coby White|0.08|0.22|0.14|\n|8|Jaxson Hayes|0.2|0.45|0.25|\n|9|Rui Hachimura|0.16|0.09|-0.07|\n|10|Cam Reddish|0.12|0.23|0.11|\n\n***\n\n#Conclusion\n\nBecause predicting All-Stars is difficult and depends on more than just college stats, our models are not objectively accurate. Nevertheless, they can provide insight into the All-Star probabilities of the top-10 picks of this year\u2019s draft.\n\nEach of the four models predicts Zion is the most likely player to make an All-Star team. Two of the models give the second spot to Morant, while two of the models give the spot to Jaxson Hayes. Relative to historical All-Stars drafted at each slot, Morant and Hayes appear to be great values, while Hunter and Garland appear poor values.\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR**: [Average predictions graph](https://i.imgur.com/c9JSRWj.png), [value above average All-Star percentage graph](https://i.imgur.com/IySAp4R.png).

Though Harden hasn't had the same team success as Jokic and Giannis, he's been averaging an absurd 34.2 PPG - almost 5 PPG more than second place Steph Curry. On the other hand, Jokic has been leading an injury-riddled Nuggets team to the first seed in the West. Along the way, he's had numerous incredible all-around performances, such as Monday's 40/10/8 game against the Trail Blazers. Jokic averages the 9th most assists per game in the league, an unprecedented figure for a center. Meanwhile, Giannis has been posting a hyper-efficient 27/12/6 while leading the Bucks to the NBA's second best record. In addition to these players, Curry and Kawhi have legitimate arguments for MVP, as they've played very well for the best teams in the league.\n\nFor much of the beginning of the season, many saw Giannis as the MVP favorite. However, the race seems tighter now than ever.\n\nTo predict who will win MVP now that we're just past the season's midway point, I created various models that try to predict this year's MVP.\n\n***\n\n#Methods\n\nThis post uses very similar methods to [my post that analyzed the least and most deserving MVPs of the past decade](https://dribbleanalytics.blogspot.com/2018/08/least-most-deserving-mvps.html). Like the initial MVP post, I use a database of all players who placed top-10 in MVP voting since the 1979-1980 season (when the 3-point line was introduced). I measured the following stats for these players:\n\n| Counting stats | Advanced stats| MVP votes | Team stats |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- |\n| G | WS | MVP votes won | Wins |\n| MPG | WS/48 | Maximum MVP votes | Overall seed |\n| PTS/G | VORP | Share of MVP votes* |  |\n| TRB/G | BPM | |\n| AST/G | | |\n| STL/G | | |\n| BLK/G | | |\n| FG% | | |\n| 3P% | | |\n| FT% | | |\n\n*Share of MVP votes = % of maximum votes received (so Curry's unanimous MVP is a vote share of 1).\n\nFor both this season and lockout seasons, I scaled up win shares, VORP, and wins to an 82 game season.\n\nMy initial MVP post used many of the above stats to predict vote share. The new models used in this post use fewer parameters, as several of the parameters in the previous post introduced collinearity. For example, having VORP, BPM, and MPG together is bad, as VORP adjusts BPM to MPG. For these models, I used only the following stats as parameters:\n\n| Counting stats | Advanced stats | Team stats |\n| ------------- | -------------- | ---------- |\n| PTS/G | VORP | Wins |\n| TRB/G | WS | Overall seed |\n| AST/G | | |\n| FG% | | |\n\nUsing these parameters to predict vote share, I created 4 models:\n\n1. Support vector regression (SVM)\n2. Random forest regression (RF)\n3. k-nearest neighbors regression (KNN)\n4. Deep neural network (DNN)\n\nUnlike the previous MVP post, the models were trained and tested using all data from the 1979-1980 season up until the 2017-2018 season. They then predict the MVP from this year's data. I predicted the MVP vote share for the top-10 players on NBA.com's January 11th MVP ladder.\n\n***\n\n#Where the models fall short\n\nLike we discussed in the previous MVP post, the MVP isn't determined only by who has the best stats. Because the models only know stats, they can't account for other factors that a media member considers when voting for MVP. These include:\n\n- Narrative\n- Expectations; the models don't know that the Nuggets weren't expected to be this good\n- Popularity; the models don't know that Giannis and Harden are much more popular players than Jokic\n- How someone scores their points; the models don't know that Harden shoots a lot of free throws\n- Triple doubles and other arbitrary thresholds\n\nGiven that the models can't account for these factors, one way we can think about these predictions is that I'm evaluating who has the most MVP-like stats out of the players.\n\n***\n\n#Understanding the data\n\nThe models predict the vote share for each of the players who were top-10 in MVP votes. It's important to note that most players will have a very low vote share, as there's usually only a few legitimate MVP contenders; the rest usually get some last place votes. To understand this distribution, I plotted a histogram of the vote share (see below).\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4KmOOgZ.png\n\nAs expected, the distribution is not normal. Most of the players had a vote share less than 0.2. This is important to consider, as a skewed dataset like this introduces more variance to the models.\n\n***\n\n#Regression analysis\n\n## Basic goodness-of-fit and cross-validation\n\nThe table below shows the r-squared and mean squared error for each of the four models. A higher r-squared and lower mean squared error indicate a more accurate model.\n\n| Model | r-squared | Mean squared error |\n| ----- | --------- | ------------------ |\n| SVM | 0.708 | 0.028 |\n| RF | 0.628 | 0.035 |\n| KNN | 0.633 | 0.035 |\n| DNN | 0.619 | 0.036 |\n\nAs with the previous MVP post, the models don't have a very high r-squared. For the most part, the models have a higher r-squared and lower mean squared error than the previous post's models, as they had more data. Though the r-squared isn't great, the mean squared is very low. In most MVP races, the winner had a vote share advantage over second place above 0.1. Therefore, because of the low mean squared error compared to the actual vote share difference, we can expect the models to be accurate in predicting the MVP.\n\nTo ensure the models aren't overfitting - or just learning the correct coefficients that yield the best results given the specific split - I performed k-fold cross-validation for r-squared. Ideally, the cross-validated r-squared will be close to the r-squared mentioned above. This would mean the models perform equally well when tested on a different split of the data. The table below shows the cross-validated r-squared scores and their 95% confidence intervals.\n\n| Model | CV r-squared | 95% confidence interval |\n| ----- | ------------ | ----------------------- |\n| SVM | 0.63 | +/- 0.10 |\n| RF | 0.50 | +/- 0.17 |\n| KNN | 0.53 | +/- 0.15 |\n| DNN | 0.57 | +/- 0.02 |\n\nAll the models have a cross-validated r-squared that's decently lower than the initial r-squared. Furthermore, the confidence intervals are wide. Therefore, it's possible the models are overfitting and may perform slightly worse on different data. However, even with these low r-squared values, the mean squared error on different datasets will not change drastically - it'll still be smaller than the usual difference between the MVP winner and second place.\n\n##Standardized residuals test\n\nA standardized residuals test analyzes the difference between the model's predicted and actual values on historical data. To pass the test, the models have at least 95% of their standardized residuals within 2 standard deviations of the mean and have no noticeable trend. Passing the standardized residuals test gives us a first indication that the models' errors are random.\n\nThe graph below shows the standardized residuals of all four models.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GIpOQ9u.png\n\nOnly the RF fails the standardized residuals test. Furthermore, there is no noticeable trend. The only concerning result from the test is the high number of values greater than 2 and below -2. This indicates high variance in the models. However, it's important to note the skewed data likely contributes to this variance.\n\n##Q-Q plot\n\nWhile the standardized residuals test determines if the errors are random, a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot examines if the errors are normally distributed. Normally distributed errors are important because they indicate that the model will perform similarly across the entirety of a dataset. In making a Q-Q plot, we're looking for the models' residuals to be as close to a 45-degree (y = x) line as possible - that indicates a normal distribution.\n\nThe graph below is the Q-Q plot for all four models' residuals.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UZ1n8CH.png\n\nThough all four models appear to have residuals pretty close to the red y = x line, there are some considerable jumps at the upper quantiles of the residuals. Each models' residuals appear to be slightly bow-shaped; they rise above the red line at the lower quantiles, fall below it in the middle, and rise again at the upper quantiles. Therefore, it's unlikely the residuals are normally distributed.\n\n##Shapiro-Wilk test\n\nTo truly determine that the residuals are normally distributed, I performed a Shapiro-Wilk test. While the Q-Q plots give a graphical representation of normality, the Shapiro-Wilk test - which returns a W-value between 0 and 1, with 1 meaning the sample is perfectly normal - gives a mathematical answer.\n\nIn addition to the W-value, the test returns a p-value. The null hypothesis of the test is that the data is normally distributed. Therefore, a p-value &lt; 0.05 means the data is not normally distributed, as we reject the null hypothesis when p &lt; 0.05.\n\nThe table below shows the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n\n| Model | W-value | p-value |\n| ----- | ------- | ------- |\n| SVM | 0.94 | &lt; 0.01 |\n| RF | 0.88 | &lt; 0.01 |\n| KNN | 0.90 | &lt; 0.01 |\n| DNN | 0.97 | 0.04 |\n\nThe results confirm what we suspected from the Q-Q plot; no model returned normally distributed residuals. Though this is concerning, it doesn't invalidate the models.\n\n##Durbin-Watson test\n\nThe Durbin-Watson test examines whether the models' residuals have autocorrelation, meaning there is a self-repeating trned in the residuals. Essentially, if the models have significant autocorrelation, they're making the same mistake over and over. The test returns a value between 0 and 4, where a value of 2 indicates no autocorrelation. Values between 0 and 2 indicate positive autocorrelation, meaning if one point is higher than the previous, then the next point is likely to be even higher. Values between 2 and 4 indicate negative autocorrelation, meaning that the points are likely to have the opposite change from the previous points.\n\nThe table below shows the results of the Durbin-Watson test.\n\n| Model | DW-value |\n| ----- | -------- |\n| SVM | 1.77 |\n| RF | 1.81 |\n| KNN | 1.85 |\n| DNN | 1.69 |\n\nAll the DW-values are between 1.5 and 2, indicating there's minimal autocorrelation.\n\n##Would we benefit from more data?\n\nCurrently, the data has two limits. First, it only goes back to the 1979-80 season so that it only includes players in the 3-point era. Second, it only includes players top-10 in MVP votes, so we could gain a few more datapoints by including everyone who received MVP votes.\n\nI think the second limitation would hurt the models if removed, as it would further skew the distribution toward low vote shares. To examine if we'd benefit from more data, I plotted the learning curve for r-squared and mean squared error (MSE) for each model.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cCy7ZFe.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/N3Bnmch.png\n\nThe lines appear to get very close for the SVM and DNN, meaning more data is unlikely to help. However, for the KNN and RF, it's possible more data may increase the models' accuracy. Given the primary way to add data to this problem is to consider all players who received votes - which skews the data - adding more data probably won't help the models.\n\n***\n\n# Results\n\nThe 4 graphs below show each model's results. Each player's current rank in NBA.com's MVP ladder. Note that these predictions were made using data from 1/14 before the games were played.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Vv1q7Fq.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3L6rZ3j.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xKj8G6e.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KDPPNw7.png\n\nAll four models have Giannis as the winner, and Harden as the runner-up. Two models have Jokic coming in third, and the other two models (which have KD and Anthony Davis in third) have Jokic in fourth.\n\nThe graph below is the average predicted vote share of the four models for each player.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OsaEkpH.png\n\nThe average shows that the models have Giannis winning MVP by a decent margin. Harden also has a decent margin on Jokic.\n\n***\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThe models crown Giannis as the MVP half-way through the year. Note that the models can't account for narrative, expectations, or voter fatigue; it's purely a statistical view.\n\nThis may change soon, as Harden scored 57 points the night I ran this analysis. With Capela out for the foreseeable and the Rockets still missing key pieces in Chris Paul and Eric Gordon, it's possible Harden ramps up his already absurd scoring pace, making a strong case for MVP.

At least from a fan's perspective. The reality is, we will never be able to reach the recent heights that Manchester City and Liverpool have reached, without a playmking goalkeeper.\n\nIt is extremely clear that ETH wants us to build from the back more, but this process is impeded by DDG's on the ball abilities. So I decided to use some simple machine learning algorithms to try to seeth through all the goalkeepers in the top 5 leagues, and identify viable, playmaking GK targets.\n\nAll data comes from: [https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/keepersadv/players/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats](https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/keepersadv/players/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats)\n\n## The Metrics\n\nBefore I go into the metrics used, let me clarify something. On all my charts, I want the high value to mean \"good.\" However, some values, like \"Avg Length of Pass\" are \"good\" when they're smallest - as this would indicate a GK's tendency to play shorter passes. So I've reversed those values on the charts so that a high value still means good. This is why some variables, (listed below) start with the prefix \"Rev.\" Note also that all values on the charts have been standardized (scaled to be between 0 and 1.)\n\nIf this is too confusing, just remember this - on the charts, the higher the value looks, the \"better\" it is for that metric for a playmaking GK.\n\nI will evaluate playmaking keepers based on 8 metrics, listed below. All stats per 90.\n\n* **Passes\\_Att**: The number of passes attempted, not including GK.\n* **Rev\\_Goal Kicks\\_AvgLen**: The average length of a Goal Kick pass.\n* **Rev\\_Goal Kicks\\_Launch%**: The percentage of Goal Kicks that were launched (passes greater than 40 yards).\n* **Rev\\_Passes\\_AvgLen**: The average length of a **Non** Goal Kick pass.\n* **Rev\\_Passes\\_Launch%**: The percentage of **Non** Goal Kicks passes that were launched (passes greater than 40 yards).\n* **Sweeper\\_AvgDist**: The average distance from goal in all defensive actions.\n* **Sweeper\\_#OPA**: Defensive actions outside of the penalty area.\n* **Crosses\\_Stp%**: Percentage of crosses in the penalty area that were successfully stopped by the GK.\n\n## The Problem\n\n## Far from the Elite\n\nSo let's see how DDG compares to two of the best playmaking goal keepers, Alisson and Ederson. Note that I'm not doing this to harp on DDG. I just want to show how these metrics really are reflective of playmaking GKs, and establish a foundation for what we need to look out for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p39rkwsgeava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=290ba99e6e2ff9bfc41485a4015c00f025c0b2b8\n\nTo the surprise of absolutely no one, Alisson and Ederson far outperform DDG in all metrics. They play more passes per game, shorter passes both from goal kicks and open play, launch a much smaller percentage of both goal kicks and open play passes (suggesting a higher tendency for short passes.) They are also both better sweeper keepers, although Alisson is a much better sweeper keeper than Ederson. But they both have very good command of their penalty box.\n\n## Inability to Build up from Goal Kicks\n\nNow, it feels a little unfair to compare him to two of the best playmaking GKs, so let's compare him to the average keeper across the top 5 leagues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uguu9tyheava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=171f157e6150c57e3231d2bed644701de23a63e3\n\nSo there are a lot of things that are bad here. Overall, he's basically worst than the average GK in all the top 5 leagues. But there are certain areas that are more important that others. He's slightly above average in open play passes, but when it comes to goal kicks, he's far worst than the rest.\n\nThis essentially means that we end up launching most of our goal kicks, which takes away from our inability to play from the back. Notice also how his passes attempted are very low, suggesting that he has very minimal involvement in the build up.\n\n## Takeaway\n\nOkay so, now, hopefully, you will trust that those metrics are indicative of playmaking GK. And understand what we are really missing with DDG. So time for the machine learning to come in.\n\n## Clustering Analysis.\n\nSo, we will use a very basic clustering analysis here, called K-means. I'm not going to go in the details of the algorithm or other steps that I took to run it, but at a high level, K-means is an algorithm that finds clusters of goalkeepers with similar abilities.\n\nThe goal is that one of those clusters comprises of goalkeepers with good playmaknig attributes, like Alisson and Ederson. And then, we can do a deep dive into goalkeepers within that cluster to find out who we should be targetting.\n\n## Visualizing Clusters\n\nThe analysis found 4 clusters in the data, i.e., 4 \"types\" of goal keepers based on their playmaking attributes. One way to visualize it is to use a method called PCA that can essentially reduce all of our 8 attributes into 2, and then visualize the groups by plotting the two newly created attributes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1yrgy4sjeava1.png?width=571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ae9fa661b1e03729590b2bdbaa89489907c9295\n\nEach dot in the plot above represents a goalkeeper. The 2 axes are essentially a combination of the 8 variables we started with. So goalkeepers that are close together on both axes, are goalkeepers that share similar playmaking attributes. Here, we can see four groups that our clustering algorithm has identified.\n\n## Describing the Clusters\n\nNow, let's look at the individual goalkeepers within the clusters, and get an average of playmaking stats for each cluster. This will tell us what the clusters really represent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgo6yq2leava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b07145c031bc03c3e51dc4c93bcddc7d4affe828\n\nThe chart above represents the average metric for each goalkeeper in a given cluster. Let's go through them one at a time\n\n* **Cluster 0**: This is the blue cluster that's barely visible because it is so small. This is essentially a cluster where all goalkeepers are bad playmakers on all front, and bad sweepers.\n* **Cluster 1**: The red cluster here is by far and away the best cluster. This is the group of goal keepers with the best playmaking abilities, and also goalkeepers with good sweeping abilities\n* **Cluster 2**: Good sweepers, bad playmakers. GKs in this cluster have good sweeping attributes, but are typically really bad playmakers.\n* **Cluster 3**: Average playmakers, bad sweepers. This is the one DDG is in, but he's a worst playmaker than most in that group.\n\n## Targets from Optimal Clusters\n\nThere is clearly one cluster that is optimal here, Cluster 1. So, I took a look at the GKs in cluster 1 and identified realistic targets. First, I removed any unrealistic GK. As you can imagine, Ederson and Alisson were in this group, so the likes of them are not considered realistic.\n\nI put a filter on age - seeing as we should be rebuilding for the future. I only consider GKs who are 30 years old or younger. Lastly, we also want our GK to be good shot stoppers, so I used the PSxGA metric, which is essentially a number that summarizes a GK ability to stop shots. Positive numbers suggest better luck or an above average ability to stop shots. So I filetered the cluster for only positive values of that metric. Below are the identified targets, including DDG as a reference point:\n\n||Player|Squad|Age|Expected\\_/90|Passes\\_Launch%|Passes\\_AvgLen|Goal Kicks\\_Launch%|Goal Kicks\\_AvgLen|Crosses\\_Stp%|Sweeper\\_#OPA|Sweeper\\_AvgDist|Passes\\_Att|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|27|Ivan Provedel|Lazio|29|0.12|28.8|33|35.4|34.7|4.1|1.51|16.6|29.9|\n|46|Brice Samba|Lens|29|0.12|34.3|32.7|26.2|29.3|7.3|1.23|16.7|29.2|\n|22|Gregor Kobel|Dortmund|26|0.09|21.7|29.4|42.5|37.8|4.9|1.57|17.3|32.7|\n|59|Alex Meret|Napoli|26|0.04|14.9|26.2|20.6|27.1|3.4|1.07|17|22|\n|75|David de Gea|Manchester Utd|33|\\-0.08|31.6|31.6|65.5|48.3|3|0.83|14.5|27.1|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wg0ah87oeava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80d629ac65c78ac643aa68fd27dc282003ce8002\n\nNow, I don't actually know anything about these goalkeepers, I'm just a numbers guy. That being said, they statistically look like better and more modern GKs than DDG. They all have far superior playmaking abilities and sweeping abilities.\n\n## Targets from Sub-Optimal Clusters\n\nWe're not done quite yet. There was one more cluster that I described as \"Decent playmakers, bad sweepers.\" Now, the cluster overall may be so, but some GKs in there might be on the upper end of the range in given metrics. They may be good playmakers and below average sweepers.\n\nI won't lie, this part of the analysis was a lot of eye balling, but nonetheless, here are 3 other GK who are better open play playmakers than DDG, but not necesasrily better sweepers:\n\n||Player|Squad|Age|Expected\\_/90|Passes\\_Launch%|Passes\\_AvgLen|Goal Kicks\\_Launch%|Goal Kicks\\_AvgLen|Crosses\\_Stp%|Sweeper\\_#OPA|Sweeper\\_AvgDist|Passes\\_Att|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|55|Yehvann Diouf|Reims|24|0.29|29.7|32.3|32.9|33.8|9.3|1.13|12.7|27.3|\n|101|Anthony Lopes|Lyon|33|0.08|32.2|32.4|31.1|32.4|5.5|0.58|12.7|24.6|\n|84|Michele Di Gregorio|Monza|26|0.05|30.5|32.4|35.3|33.4|3.1|0.72|12.4|32.8|\n|75|David de Gea|Manchester Utd|33|\\-0.08|31.6|31.6|65.5|48.3|3|0.83|14.5|27.1|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9muet1peava1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13f33e56a921520cbeafd01c326db0780cfd77a0", "relevance": 0}, {"search": 2, "content": "TikTok is now using machine learning for certain filters (e.g. \"Bold Glamour\") making them even harder to distinguish.

Don\u2019t panic. \u00a9 Take another one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I was thinking to add some DL meme at the beginning and my friend come up with this. Adel is me, by the way \\( \u0361\u275b \u1d25 \u0361\u275b\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/jmhcpovghyv61.jpg?width=1076&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eedf09c31fc497682b4dffed470f60efbb4a1617)\n\nSo, as I said, there are so many educational resources around the deep learning area that at some point I found myself lost in all that mess. There are tons of towardsdatascience/medium tutorials on how to use something, and most of them are on a beginner\u2019s level (although I enjoined some of the articles).\n\nI felt that there should be something higher than \u201cpiece of cake\u201d or \u201cbring it on\u201d levels. Like \u201chardcore\u201d or even \u201cnightmare\u201d. In the end, I want resources that will bring value, and not something I already know. I don\u2019t need detailed tutorials (well, usually), instead, I want to see directions. Some reference points from where I can start my own path. And it may be the case, that I can write such an article for others, who feel the same way.\n\nSo I came to the idea of a short \u201chow-to-and-how-not-to\u201d post on the computer vision area (mostly from DL perspective). Some links, tips, lifehacks. Hope it will create adding value for someone. And hope it won\u2019t be yet another boring tutorial.\n\nFinally, a small disclaimer: these are my personal beliefs and feelings, they are not necessarily true. Moreover, I feel that some of the points are not optimal solutions, and I would be happy if someone will propose a better option.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n## Now, let\u2019s start with the tools and infrastructure, for your CV research.\n\nIn general, several areas should be presented in your projects. There are a huge number of options in each area, and you can easily get lost. I believe that you should just choose one sample from each area and stick to it. These areas are:\n\n* Starting from simple. **Language** \u2014 without doubts, python. Others are way below. (Sorry R and [Matlab ](https://pics.me.me/pytorch-tensorflow-matlab-source-unknown-deep-learning-frameworks-war-52460350.png)users).\n* **IDE** \u2014 what IDE you will use? I personally use PyCharm, but know a lot of people who use VS Code. I know that there are Jupyter notebooks, google colabs. [Deepnote ](https://deepnote.com/)is quite a good tool as well. In fact, they all are nice, but not for proper R&amp;D nowadays. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Jupyter notebook and use it a lot, but let\u2019s be honest, it is not IDE, but rather a research prototyping environment. A combination of jupyter notebooks and proper IDE will boost your projects a lot.\n* **Frameworks** \u2014 today there are only two main players in this area: Pytorch and Tensorflow. There are hundreds of comparison articles, and both frameworks are great (some [fresh discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/k6n8m5/d_revisiting_the_tensorflow_vs_pytorch/) on Reddit). Again, just choose what you like the most and never regret it. My choice is Pytorch \u2014 like it as hell. There also wrappers of these frameworks, I use[ Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) \u2014 amazing stuff. There is a good [ecosystem around Pytroch](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) and sometimes I found something interesting and new there. Probably there is a similar thing for Tensorflow (sorry, too lazy to check)\n* **Data management** \u2014 very important and undeservedly ignored by the majority of people. There are amazing speeches of Andrej Karpathy about data importance, very inspiring \u2014 highly recommend ([this](https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7BXih7zx8) \u2014 they are about a lot of things, tbh, but also about the importance of data). This is one of his slides that tells a lot. I use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for data version control \u2014 we also created a [data registry](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registries) in our team. We keep track of all the changes in original raw data there (adding new data, reannotations, changes). Enjoying it a lot. Nice developing is happening in Activeloop: [Hub](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub) is interesting solution and worth attention. Important thing: metadata is highly valuable as well. Never underestimate its importance. Data labeling could be a separate chapter, but I decided to put it here. Again, tons of image annotation tools on the market: choose the one that fits your need. We use [supervisely](https://supervise.ly/) at the moment, super convenient in distributed labeling. In general, be prepared to spend a lot of time on data: structuring, cleaning, labeling, visualizations, etc. \u2014 all that is, in my opinion, way more important than actual straight ML/DL stuff. This is just something you should deal with. So keep calm, and spent time on data. More about data management is [here](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/lecture-8/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ I a bit remade the image to make text more visible. ](https://preview.redd.it/byx7dmxjhyv61.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d9391cd22b23f87d15dd5134d337dae1ce89557)\n\n* **MLOps** \u2014 something that everyone starts to talk about. To simplify: this is DevOps in the ML area. Probably, DVC can be related here as well. MLops is everything you will need to create a nice infrastructure for your ML projects. That includes experiments tracking, comparing, reproduction, models saving/tracking, CI/CD stuff that you can use. The market is full of free and paid packages. We use [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and like it a lot. We have an MLFlow server with a minio backend, we store all our team experiments there. At the same time, we have [a Model registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html), that helps a lot in production. It gives us version control over the models and an easy way to load them. MLflow is not the only solution, of course. Take a look at others: [W &amp; B](https://wandb.ai/site), [comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/), [neptune](https://neptune.ai/). Also, nice free book: [Introducing MLOps](https://pages.dataiku.com/oreilly-introducing-mlops) from O\u2019Reilly &amp; DataikuPlus some combination of this and previous bullet points: MLOps: From [Model-centric to Data-centric AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo) lecture from Andrew Ng.\n\n## Let\u2019s go to the methods and algorithms.\n\nCV is the most advanced field in DL (sorry NLP enthusiasts) and that causes the large variety of cool models/methods. On the other hand, each freaking day there is something new. Still, there are some classical constants that barely change. (in fact, if you are not into fundamental research, you can just choose some proven techniques and they will work. Well, most likely.)\n\n* There are always some SOTA back-bone architectures, and they are quite constant. Resnets are a good baseline, se\\_resnexts are usually way better. Efficient nets are also awesome. Unets are a solid choice for segmentation. FasterRCNN, yolos \u2014 for detection. MaskRCNN for instance segmentation (but usually you want a separate classification part).\n* A lot of nice Github repos on models mentioned above. Just google it, and find the one you like (or the one that fits in the current situation). For example, I enjoy this [pytorch segmentation repo](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch). Or this [efficient-net package](https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch).\n* Resources \u2014 first of all, [ml in reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/). All cool stuff ends up being posted there anyway, so this is a must-read resource. Then, Twitter (sorry). I am subscribed to guys like mentioned earlier Andrej Karpathy. Find the ones you respect and believe in and follow them. You can also subscribe to official Pytorch/Tensorflow/You-name-it accounts, they announce and retweet a lot of cool stuff as well. Best courses I\u2019ve seen: from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) (good DL for coders + SOTA algorithms discussed), [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/) \u2014 just the best practical course I\u2019ve seen. [Basics of conv nets](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from Stanford \u2014 classic. Kaggle is the perfect way to follow on development of the best tricks and techniques (crazy augmentations like mix up, cutmix, tricky loss functions, multi-head networks etc.). The creativeness of sportsmen (and people there are real sportsmen imho) never stops to surprise me. Plus there are usually winning solution blog post, so keep an eye on them\n\nSome words about GPUs\n\nMiners blow the market and GPUs costs like spaceship now.

It\u2019s Rick from Blitz. You might know us from our content, but for the last few months we\u2019ve also been working hard on an OP new desktop app for League. Think OP.GG + Champion.gg, combined and totally automated so all of your champion counters, runes, builds, and teammate stats are displayed and updated **in real-time** as you go through champion select and live game--no typing required.\n\nI\u2019m excited to announce that the app is now in **open beta** testing for Windows, and we\u2019d love for you to check it out: [**blitz.gg/beta**](https://blitz.gg/beta).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n******\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s cool about the Blitz app:\n\n# It\u2019s completely automated so you don\u2019t have to do any work. No typing required.\n\n[*[Gif of automation DURING CHAMP SELECT]*] (https://imgur.com/meuEfnI)\n\nWhen you enter champion select, the Blitz app automatically enters live game mode and uses computer vision to pull your teammates\u2019 summoner names and instantly display their ranked stats, champion proficiency, and playstyles. As players lock in champions, the Blitz app detects those changes and updates their stats and counter recs as you go, without you lifting a finger.\n\n# It gives build recommendations and win rates based on data from high-elo games BUT ALSO contextualizes them by matchup. \n\n[*[Screenshot here]*] (https://i.imgur.com/IinPzur.jpg)\n\nLike other tools, the Blitz app recommends champion skill order, runes, and item builds based on highest winrate and most commonly built in high-elo ranked games (through our own analysis of game and player data pulled from Riot\u2019s API - [more info here] (https://blitzesports.com/desktop/faq#blitzdata)). \n\nHowever, it also adjusts on-the-go based on your specific lane opponent. Your runes and early items should, for example, be very different if you\u2019re laning against an AP poke champ as opposed to an AD assassin. Blitz takes these differences into account and shows the most successful builds **per matchup** (statistically) so you get a more effective build for your specific situation.\n\nThere\u2019s also a handy button that instantly imports the recommended build to your League client so you don\u2019t need to look up items in-game when every second counts.\n\n# It includes champion-specific tips by high-elo players to help you counter your lane opponent.\n\n[*[Screenshot here]*] (https://i.imgur.com/oIhksMG.jpg)\n\nThere are a lot of things that numbers can\u2019t show, and one of these is a clear understanding of the playstyle, power spikes, and weaknesses of your lane opponent. We got high-elo players (big shoutout to u/Kayle_Bot and everyone who helped) to write up quick tips for countering each champion in lane--think of them as SparkNotes that you can skim while your game loads.\n\nWhen you get in game, you can also check your opponents\u2019 ranked stats and playstyles, which the Blitz app automatically pulls and displays once their summoner names are available.\n\n# Finally, it evaluates your performance after every game and breaks your play down into simple tags.\n\n[*[Screenshot here]*] (https://i.imgur.com/z1k13Q4.jpg)\n\n*You can also look [yourself up here on web. Here's Hashinshin's] (https://app.blitz.gg/lol/match/na1/hashinshin/2757275568)*\n\nSometimes you carry the game, sometimes you get carried, and sometimes you\u2019re just plain unlucky. The Blitz app automatically pulls your performance data after every game and instantly compiles a personalized post-match report card with tags like:\n\n* MVP\n* Early Game Monster (high KP% early game)\n* Unlucky :(\n* Flame Horizon\n* CS God\n* THICC (tanked most dmg in the game)\n* Got Camped\n\nThey\u2019re fun to read and easy to apply, so you can start your next game knowing where you stand and what you need to do.\n\n# And that\u2019s about it! \n\nWe\u2019re very excited to finally bring the Blitz app out in the light of day, and we hope it proves useful for all of you!\n\nHere\u2019s the [**link to the app again**] (http://blitz.gg/beta). \n\nRemember, this is a beta so we need your feedback! You can send comments, feature requests, and bug reports directly to the Blitz team in our [Discord server] (http://blitz.gg/discord).\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the app!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Edit: Blitz currently works in all servers except Garena and CN.

I've worked at NASA for almost 30 years, long enough that I got to see the ISS get put in orbit. It's generally regarded as one of the best things we've ever done, and I agree. The amount of scientific data, discovery, disaster observation, it's just priceless. We'd all be living in a worse world without that hunk of metal orbiting our planet. It's a strange feeling to see everyone talking about taking it out of the sky. On one hand the thing is getting pretty old. It was built for 15 years of operation, but it's been functional for 21 now. On the other I'm, well, a little sentimental. Maybe all the talk of dismantling it is making me feel old.\n\nPretext first.\n\nThere are many things I'm not going to tell you about myself for obvious reasons, but I can tell you my experience with NASA. They're very open about things, inside the agency as well as outside. A lot of people like to think NASA is holding some serious secrets but that's just not true. Sometimes you can't walk 20FT without hearing a young excited scientist nerding out about some new discovery or theory to their colleagues. Management puts it how it is because in this line of work everyone needs to know and if anyone miscalculates it can mean disaster. All big scientific discoveries are put on paper within 24 hours and released to the public. You all get the picture. Point is, in 30 years of working here I've never encountered much dishonesty unless a politician walked in the door. I know everyone really well, and we get along just fine.\n\nRecent events have changed everything. The excited chatter has mostly stopped, the US Government has people in suits crawling all over the place, and the higher ups obviously haven't gotten sleep since it was announced that the ISS was to be decommissioned. Despite all this we're to continue like it's business as usual, but every now and then one of us will get called up for an interview with the suits. Sometimes they'd be gone for a few minutes, sometimes they'd be gone for hours, but when they return to work we'd all ask what was going on. Every time we'd get the same answer. The suits would bring them into a room with a table, ask them some confusing un-contextual questions, then let them go.\n\nIt's not hard for us to connect the dots. Something happened in regards to the ISS. Most of us are closed off from upper management now, and those who can talk to them have that look in their eye. The look begging you not to talk to them, but they can't tell you not to. Everyone else is as confused as I am, and work has slowed to a crawl. Occasionally we'll get an exciting announcement that renews our wondrous exploratory child-brains, but for the most part it's become dreary.\n\nA few days in I got pulled into a room with the suits. There were a lot of formalities to get through like my name, age, place of birth, etc. But then the questions started. Their demeanor changed on a dime as soon as the first word was spoken, and given what that question was I would have laughed if I hadn't been dragged into a room with government agents.\n\n\"What is your opinion on the color green?\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond at first, but eventually I said: \"I guess it's an ok color. I mean, it's not my favorite, but its nice.\"\n\nI remember feeling like I was back in elementary school with the entire class talking about what color was the best. It was awkward, and due to the situation quite jarring.\n\nBellow I've got the rest of the questions and my responses that I remember.\n\nAgent: \"Do you have any aspirations besides working at NASA?\"\n\nMe: \"I've got a bucket list. Skydiving, seeing the world, that kind of thing.\"\n\nAgent: \"And do you believe you will come to complete that bucket list?\"\n\nMe: \"Well, yeah? Gotta retire at some point right?\"\n\nAgent: \"Good. Do you wish upon falling stars?\"\n\nMe: \"What? No that's... Ridiculous.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgent: \"If you did, is there anything you'd wish for?\"\n\nMe: \"Well, I dunno. Biological immortality?\"\n\nAgent: \"Do you hang posters in your room?\"\n\nMe: \"Not since I was a kid, no.\"\n\nAgent: \"What is one thing you consider objectively good?\"\n\nMe: \"Kittens?\"\n\nI said it in jest of course. Sometimes I try and break tension with a little comedy and it was out of my mouth before I knew what I was saying. Even so, I at least expected a slight smile before I was scolded, but the only thing the agent did was straighten his tie and repeat the question with a somehow even more serious look.\n\nMe: \"Fine fine. Making sure those around you live their best lives... I suppose.\"\n\nAgent: \"You suppose?\"\n\nMe: \"No I... Figure of... No that doesn't apply. Listen this is awkward. I stick by what I said, final answer, can we move on?\"\n\nIt was at this point I realized that when the agent had straightened his tie, it had changed from a formal back to a dark green. Either the agent had just pulled a magic trick with the smoothness of someone from Vegas, or I just hadn't realized it had been green the entire time. The brain has a tenancy to find patterns and lie to you, so in that moment I brushed it off, but the other two agents in the room still had black ties on.\n\nAgent: \"Yes, we can. Tell me, what is sound?\"\n\nMe: \"Well, air waves. Specifically vibrations. Right now when you speak you are sending air particles crashing into each other, sending them to me, and my ears are picking it up.\"\n\nAgent: \"Do you mind if we take your temperature?\"\n\nMe: \"No. I had mine taken at the door but I guess you can here too.\"\n\nIt was true. The agents had been taking everyone's temperature at the door these days. I didn't know why they'd need to do it a second time, but I wasn't about to argue. One of them walked over and used an unbranded digital temperature gun. After they had finished, the agent nodded to the others and I was escorted back to my floor and told to have a pleasant day. I was bombarded with questions from my colleagues, as was everyone else who got interviewed, but I didn't really have much of anything new to say.\n\nAfter that day I started doing a bit of investigating. I had only been interviewed for a few minutes, so I started asking for specifics from those who had been taken for far longer. As far as the questions themselves go I had no luck. They were still ridiculous. Things like \"Have you tasted dogwater\" or \"Have you ever gone hiking?\". But there were some consistencies too. When I brought up the green tie they said they saw the same, but brushed it off for the same reasons I did. The temperature check? It happens at the end of every interview to everyone regardless of time. But for those who got interviewed for over an hour? There was another through-line. All of them were asked what the International Space Station was to them.\n\nAt this point I knew for absolute certain that something was being kept from us regarding the ISS. No more rumors, no more speculation, no more conspiracy theories. The agents were interested in our space station too. I had to get to the bottom of this, so I contacted the guys in charge of doing the math for weight on the next supply run to the ISS. Did I mention they're still sending things up there? Because they are. Apparently they were in a tough spot. Usually you know exactly what is going into space. You have to for literally hundreds of safety reasons. But the agents had been interfering since they appeared. They'd say that something new had been added to the list, tell them the weight and then inform them that they needed to update their math to include the mystery item. It was so against code that they'd tried to take it up to management several times, but every time management shot them down. I was told that one guy was considering quitting in protest due to how unsafe just randomly adding unknown things to a spacecraft was, but the next day someone else showed up in his position. The kid was friendly, excited, and under the impression the position had been left vacant for a while. He had no idea he'd just replaced someone. I tried to get into contact with the person who was fired, but no dice. The phone number must have been bad, and I didn't know him well enough to get in contact any other way. Decided given the situation it was a bad idea for me to do so anyways. Those agents kept giving me stares when I started asking for his number. But I'd been working there for 30 years, and I had my contacts.\n\nDecided to hit up some of the old ISS crew members. I was buddy buddy with a few of them, even taking them out for drinks on occasion. I had been joking with a few of them not even a few months ago, and while our current predicament probably had nothing to do with them I had to be certain.\n\nI went through every single number but they all went to voicemail. I know people sometimes change their numbers, but all of them? I branched out beyond the US. Wasn't too close to these guys, but I'd still shared a beer with a few of them. Still nothing. Not a peep. Nothing but the robotic voice telling me to leave a message after the tone. At this point I got anxious. Not a single ISS astronaut was answering the phone. I knew where a few of them lived and started compiling the addresses, but while searching them up I came across their pages. They all have google profiles of course, but now all of them had death dates. I sat there shocked as I saw my co-workers, friends, and associates all described as having died while in the woods, in gas explosions, car accidents, even a serial killer had gotten one of them.\n\nI read into that one by the way. Someone had broken into their home. Family of four. I'll spare you the details but by the time police arrived it was to late for any of them. Allegedly the killer was high on several narcotics and died of overdose while being arrested. Several murders had been linked to him after the fact. I was shocked and heartbroken. No one had ever told me, and the way the guy went out was devastating. But then I looked at the date of the murder. I had to check my calendar, but there it was. I had taken the astronaut, his family, and several co-workers out to a movie not three days after the article said he died. It was to celebrate his full recovery after staying on the ISS so long. Things didn't line up, and while most of the death dates made sense some others didn't correlate with my calendar either. After I compiled all their addresses I took at look at the properties. All of them were closed down due to one thing or another. Gas leak had burned one down, one of them had left a stove on, a local forest fire had destroyed another, every single house was gone.\n\nAt this point I had to see it all with my own eyes. After work the next day I went on a half-hour drive to one of the closer residences. It had been a month or so but the property was owned by one of my closer buddies so it wouldn't be too strange to see me around the area. Sure enough the house was a smouldering ruin. Didn't even look like it had happened that long ago, maybe a day at most. There was even a firetruck still outside with firefighters sorting through it all. I was going to pull up and ask them what happened, but then I spotted the black van across the way. More government agents. I didn't want to be seen there, so I just drove by like anyone else would and didn't make eye contact. Could have been my paranoia, but I swore I could feel their gaze burning into the back of my skull.\n\nNow I knew. Every single ISS crewmate was gone under mysterious circumstances. I think it's the government itself, but I don't understand why. I'd like to believe they aren't actually dead, just in a holding cell somewhere until this all blows over, but I just don't know. To make matters worse I was approached at work the next day. Agents of course. They didn't bring up any specifics, just said the same thing they'd been saying from day one. Don't interfere with their business and everything will be just fine. Then they left, and the day continued as per usual. Scared me half to death though. My mind was running through the possibility that they were going to make me disappear too, and it took every ounce of mental strength I had not to look like I was caught. Not even sure I did look normal that day to be honest. I had lost a lot of sleep and was living off of coffee.\n\nAs of now? Rumors about weapons being smuggled onto the ISS are circulating, no one is allowed to go to the upper floors now, and people are starting to get replaced faster and faster. One of my colleges who's been doing some investigating of his own said he looked at the ISS through his telescope and swears to God that it was spinning out of control and half covered in something black. Took a look myself, but I couldn't find the station at all. It's definitely not on it's projected orbital path. No one outside the agency is talking about this. For all the public knows NASA plans to decommission the ISS in 2031 and land it's remains on Point Nemo, which I will add is the furthest point from human civilization on the planet. They even denied letting museums keep pieces of it, opting to just get rid of the darn thing. I'm too afraid to go to the press about it too. I don't want to be replaced because I'm pretty sure everyone who does isn't just going back home unemployed. And those agents. They've asserted even more control. I pretty much directly report to them now, and they're the only ones who go upstairs. No one has seen anyone from upper management in weeks. To make matters worse I haven't even seen the agents express a hint of remorse, or any emotion really. It's just the stone cold stare 24/7. I'm starting to think they're robots. I'm also starting to think I'm going crazy, like I've been couped up in a cage for too long with eyes on me at every waking moment.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what's going on? I need to get out of this before I end up in a cell, or worse. I think they know I'm looking into it, and I don't know what I'm going to do. My friends are gone along with half my colleagues. I just feel helpless.  \n\n\nI somehow survived to make a part 2.

Took roughly 8.5 min to get into orbit. They have a couple of days off (not because of Memorial Day). The conversation was 12 minutes long but we had to end it because of a satellite issue that was about to happens (exact reason is out of my wheelhouse). Ironically, I made him and I laser engraved rocks glasses and I was drinking out of it when he called. We also joked about some funny stuff that happened when I went out for the launch.
