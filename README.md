# Project ECHO

Submitted by: Zayne, Huanxing, Edith, Lars, Vlad and Abdel

## Project Description
ECHO is a web3 social media aggregator platform that helps disillusioned users gain control of their own feed algorithms through "finding their people." By allowing users to select their interests and connect their social media platforms, the app aggregates content across these platforms and creates a customized feed. Users engage with the content by marking what they like or dislike, enhancing the app's understanding of their preferences. This process not only refines their feed over time but also earns them tokens and progresses them towards unlocking an exclusive community feature. The community aspect is at the heart of ECHO, connecting users with others who share similar interests and values. This feature ensures that users not only see content that aligns with their preferences but also discover enriching content that broadens their horizons.

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
